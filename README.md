##### Made by ContiousAtom and JustM3Dev

## Idea
We made this bot just because we wanted to know if it would work making a bot together with someone else. First we wanted the bot to be themed(like for a game) but then we realized we could just make a bit of everything.

## Installation
#### Note: The robot is constantly changing.

```bash
git clone [repolink]
cd awesomebot
```
Make a new file called `config.ini` and put the following in it:

```ini
[BOT]
prefix = .
token = [token]
username = 
description = 
activity = a game
color = discord.color.Green

[REDDIT_BOT]
client_id = [id]
client_secret = [secret]
client_user_agent = [user agent]

[MODERATION]
```
Then open your shell and type:
```bash
py main.py
```
This should start your bot.

This bot was created using tons of librarys other people wrote.
We really appreciate your help!
